This project is a basic implementation of group chat application. A local apache server must be running with all the files being copied to htdocs folder in the local servers files. Then there are 4 ch.html files which needs to be opened in different tabs. Now whatever is typed in textbox in chat and sent will be shown in each of the tabs. This is implemented using Server Side Events. And even images can be sent through this chat using Cross Origin Resource Sharing(CORS). 
The server.php has Events called 'data' and 'images' and each ch.html is listening to these events generated from the server. The event 'data' is caused on change/modtime in chat.txt which is updated when any user types and sends in their respective chat. The event 'image' is caused on update to image.txt i.e. when someone chooses to upload an image to the chat. 
Each upload from image causes that image to be moved to the local directory of images in htdocs and then displayed in the chat.
